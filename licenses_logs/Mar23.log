 4:02:52 (lmgrd) SLOG: Summary LOG statistics is enabled.
 4:02:52 (lmgrd) The license server manager (lmgrd) running as root:
 4:02:52 (lmgrd) 	This is a potential security problem
 4:02:52 (lmgrd) 	and is not recommended.
 4:03:07 (lmgrd) The TCP port number in the license, 27020, is already in use.
 4:03:07 (lmgrd) Possible causes: 
 4:03:07 (lmgrd)    1) The license server manager (lmgrd) is already running for this license.
 4:03:07 (lmgrd)    2) The OS has not "cleared" this port since lmgrd died.
 4:03:07 (lmgrd)    3) Another process is using this port number (unlikely).
 4:03:07 (lmgrd) Solutions:
 4:03:07 (lmgrd)    1) Make sure lmgrd and all vendor daemons for this 
 4:03:07 (lmgrd)       license are not running.
 4:03:07 (lmgrd)    2) You may have to wait for the OS to clear this port.
